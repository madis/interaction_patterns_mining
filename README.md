Data-Mining course project
==========================

Description
-----------

We are collecting data about operators (client support and sales agents) and web page visitors actions on the page(clicks, mouse movements, buttons clicked, chat between operator-visitor). The goal of the platform is to have them interact and either generate a sale or a lead (personal information for contacting in future). This tries to find behaviour patterns i.e. these that result in engagements, that produce most value to the company so the potential customers could be ranked and/or operators could be trained to follow certain rules to reach 'ideal interaction'.

Demo application

This project includes a rails demo application.
